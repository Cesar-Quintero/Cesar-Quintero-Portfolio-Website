# Portfolio Website

My portfolio wesbite. It contains links to my social media accounts and to my live wesite projects. I used a template from https://dev.to/rammcodes and customized my information and contact-code into it.

# What I Learned

* Setting up the back-end for the contact form which allows users to send me an email message when submitting the form
* Open a "thank you" page after user submits the form
